Customer Support Ticket Dataset
**Introduction**
This dataset contains customer support ticket data, which includes information about customer interactions with the support team for various product-related issues. 
It tracks the details of the ticket such as the type of issue, the product involved, the communication channel used, the resolution status, and the customerâ€™s satisfaction rating.
This dataset can be useful for various analyses and business intelligence tasks such as:
Customer Satisfaction Analysis:
Understanding how quickly and effectively support tickets are resolved and how this correlates with customer satisfaction ratings.
Support Team Performance:
Analyzing the response time and resolution time to gauge the performance of customer support teams.
Product Issues and Trends:
Identifying common technical issues or product defects based on ticket descriptions and subjects.
Customer Demographics:
Analyzing if there are any trends in ticket submissions based on age, gender, or other demographic data.
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Ticket ID**: Unique identifier for each customer support ticket
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer who raised the support ticket
- **Product Purchased**: The product related to the ticket
- **Ticket Type**: Type of the issue (e.g., Technical issue, Billing inquiry)
- **Ticket Status**: Status of the ticket (e.g., Pending, Closed)
- **Resolution**: Resolution description (if available)
- **Ticket Priority**: Priority level of the ticket (e.g., Critical, Low)
- **First Response Time**: Time when the customer first received a response
- **Time to Resolution**: Time taken to resolve the issue
- **Customer Satisfaction Rating**: Rating given by the customer after the issue was resolved
### Data Preprocessing
- The `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook covers the steps to clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.

### Model Training
- The `model_training.py` script shows how to train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest using the dataset. The models are evaluated using cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve their performance.

### Example Analysis
- The `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we analyze trends, correlations, and visualize the data.
